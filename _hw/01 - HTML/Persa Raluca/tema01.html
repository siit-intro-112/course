      <p style="font-size: 50px;"></p>The county seat is located at Baia Mare. The city has an international airport, so you can get to Maramureș by plane. It takes approximately 1h to fly from Bucharest to Baia Mare.
    
      <p>If you wish to discover more of the beauty of Romania on your way to Maramureș, I recommend you try getting there by train or by car. 

Going by train from Bucharest to Maramureș takes between 12 and 18 hours. You may want to depart from other cities, like Cluj Napoca, for example. It has an international airport and is very well connected to other international European countries, like the UK, Spain or Germany. From Cluj Napoca, you can take the train to Baia Mare, and your trip will last between 4 and 6 hours. 

If you plan to go by car, you must know that from Bucharest until Baia Mare, there are around 619 km. Because of the diverse geography of Romania and unfortunately underdeveloped infrastructure, it can take you almost 8 hours to get there by car. However, the road is splendid, and you can take this opportunity to make a stop of 1-2 days on your way to see other beautiful locations such as Sighisoara or Sibiu.

   <h3>Where to stay?</h3>

   <p>I really enjoy sustainable travel, and I never miss the opportunity to contribute to the local communities while traveling. Suppose you wish to combine sustainable travel with an authentic holiday experience. In that case, I advise you to look for small traditional guesthouses or local family-run businesses. Of course, you will also find nice hotels in Baia Mare with excellent conditions. Still, there’s nothing like the genuine rural experience you will have by choosing to stay at locals.

   <p>You will get to know them, hear the legends of these places, and thoroughly enjoy countryside life with all of its particularities and folklore. They will tell you about off-the-beaten-track mountain trails, areas that are not so well known to all tourists but filled with natural beauty and wilderness.
